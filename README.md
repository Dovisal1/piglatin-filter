#Piglatin-filter

A c++ program to encode plain text into pig-latin.

This code is my solution to a homework assignment from [Professor Yedidyah Langsam](http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/academics/faculty/faculty_profile.jsp?faculty=343) of the Brooklyn College Computer Science Department for the semester of Fall 2014.
